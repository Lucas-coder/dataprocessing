            <h1>Mortality rates from neurological diseases in the European Union in 2015</h1>
            <p1>
                A neurological disease can be defined by a disorder of the
                nervous system. Neurological diseases can have fatal consequences.
                Moreover, World Health Organization (WHO) data shows an increased
                global burden of mortality from neurological diseases from the
                early 1989-1991 to 2012-2014 [1]. Additionally, this increased
                burden is most visible in the USA. As a matter of fact, WHO data
                shows that the mortality rate from neurological diseases is higher
                in western countries than the rest of the world.
            </p1>
            </br></br>
            <p2>
                These WHO findings make it valuable to zoom in to a group of
                western countries, namely the European Union (EU). In the
                visualization a map with the EU countries is depicted (including
                some non-EU countries). The colors represent the mortality rate
                of the countries. Additionally, you can switch to a map that depicts
                the population of the countries. When a country is selected, the
                graph on the right shows the mortality rates of that country of
                Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease and the other neurological
                diseases.
            </p2>
            </br></br>
            <p3>
                The main observations from this visualization are: 1) Alzheimer's
                Disease is greatest contributer to mortality rate; 2) the mortality
                rates appear higher in the Western European countries than in the
                Eastern European countries; 3) Finland appears to have a much
                higher mortality rate from neurological diseases than the other
                countries. While the first two observations are not explained yet,
                a paper in Brain Research has some interesting explanations for
                the high mortality in Finland [2].
